# graph-theory-proj

My Name is Daniel Fitzsimons
This is my end of year project for graph theory
within this repo you will see my understanding of graph theory and certain components within it.
Use of jupyter notebook and python code allowed me to implement the thory, pictures and code needed to show my understanding of this module.

Upon completing this notebook i feel like my knowledge of the module has been greatly enhanced in realtion to preparing for my exam and to understand the learning within the module.
